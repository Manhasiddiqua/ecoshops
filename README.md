## Shop Sustainable. Shop Safe. Shop Eco

Our website EcoShops is a platform that cross-examines products and links throughout the internet to help users find the most sustainable and eco-friendly option for their wants and needs.

With EcoShops, our website outlines the product's material composition, highlights the sustainable resources used, and gives some background information about the website and the company they are shopping from. Then it allows users to find second-hand products that are available on various sites that are upcycled versions of the product the consumer desires, offering a cheaper and sustainable solution. Our platform also allows users to find alternatives that are already sustainably produced and follow ethical guidelines. This way, users can find certified alternatives which are ethical and minimize the unnecessary waste that arises from buying new products at stores, allowing upcycled products to find a new home.
